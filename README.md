# xG-project
Important! This project is originally a school project and was added to github in the original format. The length of the report was limited to four pages which is the reason for rather short analysis.
The datafiles used in the project could not be added to git due file size issues so only the code and final report could be included.
Original data can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/2 and it was first published at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7

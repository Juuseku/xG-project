# xG-project
Important! This project is originally a school project and was added to github in the original format. The length of the report was limited to four pages.
The datafiles used in the project could not be added to git due file size issues so only the code and final report could be included.
Original data can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/2 and it was first published at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7
By downloading the files 'players.json' and 'events_England.json' the code can be run locally. Further introduction to the project and analysis of the results can be found from the 'xG-project.pdf' file located in this repository

# Introduction
Expected goals (xG) is the most trending metrics in the world of football right now. Since it surfaced, it has 
been a constant topic of conversation when evaluating playersâ€™ performance. Suddenly a player might not be 
as good anymore even if he or she scores 30 goals per season, if he should have scored 40 according to his/her 
xG value. In this project, I aim to construct a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a field event 
resulting in a goal and quantify it as xG. I will begin by discussing the problem formulation and the methods 
used to build the models, followed by the presentation of results, and ultimately, the conclusion.
